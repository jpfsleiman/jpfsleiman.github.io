            <h1>My Experience at AGU's Congressional Visits Days</h1>
        </header>
        <p>In early September 2024, I had the incredible opportunity to travel to Washington, D.C., to participate in AGU's Congressional Visits Days (CVDs). This event, sponsored annually by AGU, allows members to engage directly with policymakers to discuss the importance of federally funded scientific research. Traditionally held in person, AGU also offers virtual options to ensure accessibility for all participants.</p>

        <p>The two-day event began with a comprehensive science policy workshop, hosted by AGU in collaboration with other geoscience society partners such as the Geological Society of America (GSA), Seismological Society of America (SSA), and American Meteorological Society (AMS). The workshop was designed to help us understand how science informs the lawmaking process and the crucial role that scientists play in advocating for evidence-based policy.</p>

        <p>During the first day of the workshop, we engaged with policy experts who work in Congress and across the federal government. They provided us with valuable insights into the current landscape of science policy and shared strategies for effectively communicating scientific topics to legislators. One of the highlights was learning how the public and private sectors collaborate in the policymaking process, something I hadn't fully appreciated before attending.</p>

        <p>The following day, we put this knowledge into action. I met with members of Congress and their staff to discuss pressing issues in our districts. We focused on how science-focused legislation can address the challenges we face, particularly in areas such as environmental protection and climate change mitigation. </p>

        <p>For anyone interested in participating in these events, AGU provides an excellent toolkit for meeting with your member of Congress. Whether you're able to attend in person or virtually, I highly recommend getting involved. Itâ€™s a unique chance to make your voice heard and help shape science policy for the better.</p>
